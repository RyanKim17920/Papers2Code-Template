# Best Practices for Paper Implementations

Optional guidelines inspired by NeurIPS code release recommendations. Use what makes sense for your implementation.

## ✨ What Makes a Good Implementation?

The goal is to help others understand, verify, and build upon the paper. You're recreating research, so perfect reproduction may not always be possible - that's okay!

## 📝 Suggested README Sections

Your README is auto-populated with the basics. Consider adding:

### 1. **Results (If Applicable)**

**If you trained the model:**
```markdown
| Metric | Paper | This Implementation | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Accuracy | 95.2% | 94.8% | Different dataset split |
```

**If you only implemented the architecture:**
```markdown
## Implementation Status

- ✅ Model architecture implemented
- ✅ Forward pass tested
- ❌ Training not performed (computational constraints)
- See `src/model.py` for architecture implementation
```

### 2. **Limitations & Assumptions**
Be honest about differences from the paper:
- "Used Adam optimizer instead of custom optimizer described in paper"
- "Approximated XYZ technique due to unclear specification"
- "Trained for 50 epochs instead of 100 due to compute constraints"

### 3. **Implementation Details**
Share what you learned:
- Key insights from implementing the paper
- Tricky parts that weren't obvious
- Hyperparameters that worked well
- Things that didn't work as expected

## 🎯 Recommended (Not Required)

### Dependencies
```bash
# Add to requirements.txt
torch>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
# ... list everything needed
```

### Training Instructions (If Applicable)
**Only if you trained the model!** Many papers require expensive compute - it's totally fine to just implement the architecture.

```bash
# If you trained it, make it easy to reproduce
python train.py --config configs/paper.yaml
```

### Evaluation (If You Have Results)
```bash
# Let others verify your results
python evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best.pth
```

### Pre-trained Models (If You Trained One)
If you trained a model successfully, consider sharing:
- Upload to [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)
- Or use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
- Or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com) (up to 2GB)

## 🚫 Don't Stress About

This is a community implementation, not the official release. You don't need:
- ❌ Perfect reproduction of paper results
- ❌ Training the model (especially if computationally expensive!)
- ❌ Every experiment from the paper
- ❌ Production-ready code
- ❌ Extensive documentation

**Do stress about:**
- ✅ Being honest about what you implemented
- ✅ Clear enough for others to understand
- ✅ Sharing what you learned
- ✅ Documenting limitations upfront

## 📊 Results Section

Be transparent about what you did:

### ✅ Good Examples

**If you trained:**
```markdown
## Results

| Metric | Paper | This Implementation |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Accuracy | 92.5% | 91.8% |

**Notes:** Used a different learning rate schedule. Results are close.
```

**If you only implemented architecture:**
```markdown
## Implementation Status

- ✅ Core model architecture implemented and tested
- ✅ Forward pass verified with random inputs
- ❌ Did not train due to computational costs (~$500 for full training)
- ❌ No pre-trained weights available

**Architecture verified:** Model runs and produces expected output shapes.
```

**If you did partial training:**
```markdown
## Results

Trained for 10 epochs (paper used 100) on subset of data:

| Metric | Paper | This Implementation |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Accuracy | 92.5% | 78.3% |

**Note:** Limited compute - trained on 10% of dataset for 10 epochs as proof of concept.
```

### ❌ Avoid
```markdown
## Results

Got similar results to the paper.
```
(No details about what "similar" means or what was actually done)

## 🔧 Implementation vs Recreation

You're **recreating** the paper, not releasing official code. This means:

### It's okay to:
- Make reasonable simplifications
- Use different libraries/tools
- Not implement every detail
- **Not train the model if it's too expensive**
- Just implement the architecture
- Get close but not exact results
- Document what you couldn't implement

### Try to:
- Implement core contributions of the architecture
- Test the forward pass works
- Document major decisions
- Share your learnings
- Be honest about what you did/didn't do

## �️ Architecture-Only Implementations Are Valid!

Many papers require significant compute (GPUs, TPUs, days/weeks of training). **It's totally fine to just implement the architecture!**

### What's valuable:
- ✅ Correct model architecture
- ✅ Working forward pass
- ✅ Clear, readable code
- ✅ Architecture documentation
- ✅ Honest about scope

### Example README:
```markdown
## Implementation Status

This repository implements the model architecture from the paper.

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Complete model architecture (src/model.py)
- ✅ Forward pass tested and working
- ✅ Architecture matches paper specifications

**Not Implemented:**
- ❌ Training pipeline (requires ~200 GPU hours)
- ❌ Full evaluation suite

**Contribution:** This provides a starting point for others who want 
to train the model or use it as a component in their work.
```

This is **extremely valuable** to the community! Others can:
- Use your architecture in their projects
- Build training pipelines on top
- Study the implementation details
- Verify the architecture is correct

## �🎓 Learning > Perfect Reproduction

The goal is:
1. **Understand** the paper deeply
2. **Share** your implementation with others
3. **Help** the community learn
4. **Document** what works and what doesn't

Not to:
- Match paper results exactly
- Train expensive models
- Implement every experiment
- Create production code

## 💡 Quick Wins

Easy things that add a lot of value:

1. **Clear setup instructions**
   ```bash
   uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Example usage**
   ```python
   from src.model import Model
   model = Model()
   output = model(input)
   ```

3. **Honest limitations section**
   - What you changed and why
   - What you couldn't implement
   - "Did not train - architecture only" is totally valid!
   - Known issues

4. **Link to paper discussions**
   - Link to Papers2Code discussion
   - OpenReview comments
   - Related implementations

## 🤝 Community Spirit

Remember:
- Others will learn from your code
- Be kind to future contributors
- Document for your future self
- Honest limitations > false claims
- "I couldn't get this to work" is valuable information!

## 🎯 The Ultimate Goal

> **"Make it easy for someone else to understand what you did, why you did it, and what worked."**

That's it! Everything else is optional.
